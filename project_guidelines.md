Course Project:

Your project is to build a personalized research agent, applying all you’ve learned:

Week 1: Project kickoff, define your agent’s goal
Week 4: Project Insight I (peer/TA review of your idea)
Week 7: Project Insight II (finalize scope and direction)
Week 10: Final project demo—showcase your agent!
Project Rules:

All code must be in your own GitHub repo.
Submit your project repo link via Canvas when prompted.
All submissions must be your own work—collaboration for discussion and Q&A is encouraged, but code must be original.
