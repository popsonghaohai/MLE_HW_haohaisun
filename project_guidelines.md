Course Project:

Your project is to build a personalized research agent, applying all you‚Äôve learned:

Week 1: Project kickoff, define your agent‚Äôs goal
Week 4: Project Insight I (peer/TA review of your idea)
Week 7: Project Insight II (finalize scope and direction)
Week 10: Final project demo‚Äîshowcase your agent!
Project Rules:

Community
Join the course Discord: For Q&A, code sharing, project brainstorming, and peer support.
Peer Feedback: Comment on at least two peers‚Äô project ideas (via Discord or Canvas discussion).
MCP & Open Tools: You‚Äôll set up and experiment with tools like MCP (Model Context Protocol) and the latest open-source agents (LangChain, vLLM, etc).
üõ†Ô∏è Submission Rules & Best Practices

Homework:
Complete all tasks in one repo.
Submit via Canvas‚Äîpaste your GitHub repo link for each week‚Äôs assignment.
Project:
Each project phase (insight, final demo) requires a separate repo submission via Canvas.
Repo Organization:
Use clear folders, commit messages, and documentation.
Cite all outside resources and credit all collaborators.


All code must be in your own GitHub repo.
Submit your project repo link via Canvas when prompted.
All submissions must be your own work‚Äîcollaboration for discussion and Q&A is encouraged, but code must be original.
