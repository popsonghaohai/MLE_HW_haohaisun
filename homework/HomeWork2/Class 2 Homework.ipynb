    "Tesseract is an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine developed by Google. It is used to convert scanned images, PDFs, and images with text into machine-readable text. Tesseract supports more than 100 languages, including complex scripts like Arabic, Chinese, and many others.\n",
