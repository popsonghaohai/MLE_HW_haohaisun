Thinking...
Okay, so I need to write a compelling marketing email for "Artisan Roast," their premium coffee subscription
service from Ethiopia. They're launching a new single-origin coffee blend, which is exclusive and benefits from
being from Ethiopia. The target audience are coffee enthusiasts who love quality and story—so they probably like
the unique blends that tell a story or offer something personal.

First, I should start with a strong subject line to grab attention. Something catchy like "Discover Exceptional
Coffee from Ethiopia" sounds inviting. It implies exclusivity and uniqueness, which aligns with their
single-origin blend.

Next, the preheader text needs to introduce the product clearly. Since it's exclusive, emphasizing that will make
them curious about why this particular blend is chosen. I should mention it's a premium coffee, so highlighting
its quality and exclusivity sets a high standard.

Then, in the email body, I need to offer something valuable. The new blend being single-origin from Ethiopia makes
sense as a unique selling point. I can highlight how it's not just good coffee but also special because of that
origin story. Emphasizing personalization and customization will appeal to customers who appreciate their
experiences.

I should include why they should try this blend—maybe by mentioning the quality, flavors, or personalization
aspect. Including a link to their website adds credibility. A call-to-action button will encourage them to sign up
and test it out, making the email feel exclusive.


Finally, I'll wrap it up with a warm closing that reinforces enthusiasm and invites them to join the coffee
revolution. Something like "Thank you for your loyalty" shows appreciation, and ending on a positive note can
leave a lasting impression.

I should make sure the tone is warm, exclusive, and enthusiastic throughout—no overly formal language but enough
personal touch. Keeping paragraphs short will help maintain readability and impact.
